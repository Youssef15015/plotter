A python wrapper that uses root to reshape data bins and zoom 
(interactive and non-interactive) via interaction with the command terminal. 
This Plotter is intended to be use for learning purpose. It is also a good wrapper for 
more complicated projects. 
To use this, make sure you set the correct python path in the first line, and install
root with pyroot enabled (you can probably find a pre-complied source on the website).
